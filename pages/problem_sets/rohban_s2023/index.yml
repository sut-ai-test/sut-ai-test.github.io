title: CE417 - Fall 2022 - Prof. Rohban
content: |
  One of CE-417's goals is to prepare you to apply fundamental Artificial Intelligence and 
  Machine Learning algorithms to semi-realistic tasks and ensure that you have a solid 
  understanding of the fundamentals of AI. The extensive problem sets of the course are 
  curated to serve as a means for achieving this purpose.
  Please upload your answers to Quera on time; otherwise you would not earn any 
  credit for them. Take a note of these points regarding your assignments:
  * You will have **6 Assignments** Accounting for 50% of your overall grading
  * You are given **15 “grace days”** (self-granted extensions) in total for each assignment,
    which you can use to give yourself extra time without penalty.
  * Every assignment has a hard deadline &mdash; which is **7** days after the original due date (except for the last assignment 
    which has no delay)&mdash; after which no submission is accepted. 
  * Delays are calculated hourly; minutes and seconds are rounded up.
  * You can choose how you wish to distribute your grace-days among your assignments at the
    end of the semester.
  If you have any questions regarding the problems, visit the appropriate forum in Quera. 
  Keep in mind that no changes can be made to assignments at the last minute; therefore, please 
  have a look at the questions at least a week before the assignment's due date. No deadline will 
  be extended, and it is entirely on you to manage your 
  time and use your grace days accordingly. Finally, a word of advice, don't procrastinate 
  everything up until the deadlines.
