      This course offers a gentle introduction to the concepts and methodologies in Artificial Intelligence from
      both theoretical and practical perspectives. This includes designing intelligent agents through techniques
      such as state-space search methods, knowledge representation and inference, and Machine Learning. By the end
      of this course, students are expected to have the ability to develop intelligent solutions for semi-real
      world problems using the appropriate methods discussed in the course. Furthermore, they are expected to gain
      knowledge and experience in analyzing the inner workings of these methods and customizing them for specific
      problems.
